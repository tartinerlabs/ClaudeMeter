## [0.14.2] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- Rebuilt and verified against Xcode 27 / macOS 27 (build and full test suite pass on the new SDK).

### Fixed
- Two environment-dependent test failures: `returnsNilForUnknownModel` raced the live LiteLLM pricing map (which now legitimately prices `gpt-4`) and asserts the static fallback instead; `initialStateIsCorrect` leaked the real app's cached usage snapshot from the shared UserDefaults domain and now stashes and restores it.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- Use LiteLLM pricing data as the source of truth for token cost calculations, preferring a configured LiteLLM proxy's `/model/info` pricing and falling back to LiteLLM's hosted model cost map.
- Refresh LiteLLM pricing before local token imports, zero-cost recalculation, live provider aggregation, and blog usage sync so newly released models such as Claude Mythos/Fable 5 can be priced without hardcoded app updates.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Per-provider service outage detection. When a provider's usage fetch fails with an HTTP 5xx / service-unavailable error, ClaudeMeter now tracks an outage and shows a "Service down" indicator on that provider's card (menu bar popover) and a banner on its detail page (menu bar + Dashboard), while continuing to show cached data. Covers Claude, Codex, and OpenCode; the indicator clears automatically on the next successful fetch.

### Fixed
- OpenCode Go dashboard usage windows never parsed due to a malformed regex (raw-string delimiter bug), so OpenCode rate-limit windows were always missing. The parser now extracts rolling/weekly/monthly usage correctly.
- Manual refresh is no longer throttled — pressing refresh always fetches immediately (the 5-second cooldown only applied to forced refreshes and is removed).

## [0.13.5] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- Stop the remaining macOS keychain authorization prompt on launch, caused by blog usage sync reading its bearer token in-process. The token is now stored and read via the `/usr/bin/security` CLI — whose stable Apple-signed binary lets the keychain "Always Allow" grant persist — instead of in-process keychain APIs that re-prompt on every launch for the unsigned app. After updating, re-enter the blog sync token once in Settings.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- Stop a recurring macOS keychain authorization prompt on launch. The app no longer writes a copy of the Claude credentials into its own keychain on every refresh — that write was unused (macOS reads the token directly from Claude Code via the `security` CLI, and iCloud sync is not enabled) and was the source of the repeated "ClaudeMeter wants to use your confidential information" dialog.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- Codex 5-hour and weekly windows now read live usage from the ChatGPT backend (`/wham/usage`) using the `~/.codex/auth.json` token, instead of stale local rollout logs. Usage consumed via OpenCode/ChatGPT is now reflected, fixing the menu bar showing 0% when the local Codex CLI logs were stale. Falls back to hiding the Codex column on any error rather than showing a fabricated 0%.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- Skip Claude Code `<synthetic>` placeholder rows during blog usage sync so zero-token internal messages are not stored as Anthropic model usage.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-06-07

### Removed
- Credentials status section from Settings (no longer needed).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- Multi-provider usage monitoring (macOS): track **OpenAI Codex CLI** and **OpenCode** alongside Claude.
- Codex rate-limit windows (5-hour + weekly) and plan, read from local Codex rollout logs — no login required.
- Token usage & cost for Codex and OpenCode, computed from local logs (OpenCode via its SQLite database) using built-in pricing.
- OpenUsage-style menu-bar popover: a provider sidebar that switches between an overview and per-provider detail pages, each with Status/Console links, window status dots, Today/Yesterday/30-day cost, a usage-trend sparkline, and a per-model breakdown.
- Shared per-provider cards across the menu bar and Dashboard.
- "Codex (5h)" menu-bar display toggle in Settings.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Fix synced usage pricing
- Align blog usage sync contract

## [0.12.1] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- Removed the ccusage backend; the native Claude JSONL parser is now the sole source of token usage and cost. Displayed totals are Claude-only and priced at Anthropic rates, fixing discrepancies caused by ccusage running unscoped across all coding agents with LiteLLM pricing.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- Add passive blog usage sync for local agent usage.
- Add blog sync settings for endpoint URL, bearer token, manual sync, and sync status.

### Fixed
- Fix release metadata and Sparkle appcast release notes so updater notes render correctly.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- Track Claude Design usage as a third weekly window (alongside All models and Sonnet)
- Show Claude Design in macOS menu bar icon, popover, and Dashboard; iOS Dashboard; and Medium/Large widgets
- Add `menuBarShowDesign` toggle in macOS Settings (Menu Bar Display)
- Add `notifyDesign` threshold notifications in macOS Settings (Notifications)
- Add Claude Design as a Live Activity metric on iOS

## [0.10.8] - 2026-03-18
